I use geochemistry to probe the ecology of modern and extinct cephalopods. This group is an important component modern and ancient marine ecosystems. Ammonoids are a particularly important group in the fossil record and are used to construct the geological timescale and study evolution.

I am interested in using new geochemical tools to investigate questions related to behavior, lifespan, and metabolism at a variety of spatial and temporal scales.
