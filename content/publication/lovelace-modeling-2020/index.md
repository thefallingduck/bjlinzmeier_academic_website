abstract: We employed the widely-tested biophysiological modeling software, Niche
  Mapper™ to investigate the metabolic function of the Late Triassic dinosaurs Plateosaurus
  and Coelophysis during global greenhouse conditions. We tested a variety of assumptions
  about resting metabolic rate, each evaluated within six microclimate models that
  bound paleoenvironmental conditions at 12° N paleolatitude, as determined by sedimentological
  and isotopic proxies for climate within the Chinle Formation of the southwestern
  United States. Sensitivity testing of metabolic variables and simulated “metabolic
  chamber” analyses support elevated “ratite-like” metabolic rates and intermediate
  “monotreme-like” core temperature ranges in these species of early saurischian dinosaur.
  Our results suggest small theropods may have needed partial to full epidermal insulation
  in temperate environments, while fully grown prosauropods would have likely been
  heat stressed in open, hot environments and should have been restricted to cooler
  microclimates such as dense forests or higher latitudes and elevations. This is
  in agreement with the Late Triassic fossil record and may have contributed to the
  latitudinal gap in the Triassic prosauropod record.
