abstract: 'Serially sampled oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) from fossil and modern cephalopods
  may provide new insight into the behavior and longevity of individuals. Interpretation
  of these data is generally more difficult than similar data from bivalves or brachiopods
  because the measured δ18O from shell combines both seasonal change and depth change
  over the life of an individual. In this paper, a simple null model is presented
  combining the three fundamental controls on a measured δ18O profile in a free-swimming
  organism: swimming behavior, seasonal water column change, and time averaging in
  sampling. Model results indicate that seasonal variability in δ18O in a free-swimming
  organism can be interpreted in locations with strong seasonality through most of
  the swimming range but is complicated by swimming velocity and is sometimes best
  expressed by changes in δ18O variance rather than simple sinusoidal patterns. In
  other locations with a stable thermocline or seasonal ranges in only a small portion
  of the water column, no variability caused by seasonality would be expected. Furthermore,
  large ranges of δ18O (~ 4‰) are possible within and between individuals in settings
  with persistent thermoclines like the tropics, depending on the swimming depth limits
  and behavior of individuals. These results suggest that future interpretation of
  serially sampled δ18O should consider seasonal water column variation from either
  modern or modeling sources in addition to comparison to co-occurring benthic and
  planktonic organisms. Additionally, this modeling casts doubt on the promise of
  isotope sclerochronology alone as a growth chronometer in ammonites and other free-swimming
  fossil organisms and highlights the need for other methods of quantitatively determining
  age.'
