abstract: Carbonate skeletons of fossil marine organisms are widely used to
  reconstruct palaeoceanographic parameters. Specifically, the geochemistry of
  Jurassic and Cretaceous belemnite rostra is traditionally interpreted to
  represent near sea-surface seawater properties. More recently, an increasing
  number of workers, have reported significant scatter in geochemical data
  (e.g., δ18O, δ13C, element/Ca ratio) when comparing rostra from the same
  stratigraphic level or within a single belemnite rostrum. This scatter is not
  explained by differential diagenetic overprint alone. Here we report
  petrographic evidence on the primary ultrastructure of rostra of Megateuthis
  (Middle Jurassic) and Belemnitella and Gonioteuthis (Late Cretaceous). The
  biogenic ultrastructure consists of a filigree framework of triaxial branches
  and tetrahedrons of variable size forming a honeycomb-like network. Data
  presented here suggest that these rostra yielded as much as 50 to 90% primary
  pore space. On the level of a working hypothesis – and in analogy with modern
  cephalopods – we propose that the pore space was formerly filled with body
  fluid and/or organic compounds during the life time of these organisms.
  Intra-rostral porosity was post mortem occluded by earliest diagenetic
  isopachous calcite cements of a non-biogenic origin. These may have been
  precipitated due to increased alkalinity related to the decay of organic
  matter. If this holds true, then the resulting fabric represents a composite
  biogenic/abiogenic structure. In order to optically separate the two calcite
  phases forming a single calcite fibre, we employed a wide range of
  state-of-the-art analytical tools to thin sections and ultra-thin sections of
  well-preserved specimens. Pending a verification of these well-supported
  ultrastructural data by means of high-resolution geochemical analyses from
  biogenic and abiogenic phases, we suggest that these findings have
  significance for those using belemnite rostra as archives of their
  palaeoenvironment.
