abstract: Heteromorphs are ammonoids forming a conch with detached whorls (open coiling)
  or non-planispiral coiling. Such aberrant forms appeared convergently four times
  within this extinct group of cephalopods. Since Wiedmann's seminal paper in this
  journal, the palaeobiology of heteromorphs has advanced substantially. Combining
  direct evidence from their fossil record, indirect insights from phylogenetic bracketing,
  and physical as well as virtual models, we reach an improved understanding of heteromorph
  ammonoid palaeobiology. Their anatomy, buoyancy, locomotion, predators, diet, palaeoecology,
  and extinction are discussed. Based on phylogenetic bracketing with nautiloids and
  coleoids, heteromorphs like other ammonoids had 10 arms, a well-developed brain,
  lens eyes, a buccal mass with a radula and a smaller upper as well as a larger lower
  jaw, and ammonia in their soft tissue. Heteromorphs likely lacked arm suckers, hooks,
  tentacles, a hood, and an ink sac. All Cretaceous heteromorphs share an aptychus-type
  lower jaw with a lamellar calcitic covering. Differences in radular tooth morphology
  and size in heteromorphs suggest a microphagous diet. Stomach contents of heteromorphs
  comprise planktic crustaceans, gastropods, and crinoids, suggesting a zooplanktic
  diet. Forms with a U-shaped body chamber (ancylocone) are regarded as suspension
  feeders, whereas orthoconic forms additionally might have consumed benthic prey.
  Heteromorphs could achieve near-neutral buoyancy regardless of conch shape or ontogeny.
  Orthoconic heteromorphs likely had a vertical orientation, whereas ancylocone heteromorphs
  had a near-horizontal aperture pointing upwards. Heteromorphs with a U-shaped body
  chamber are more stable hydrodynamically than modern Nautilus and were unable substantially
  to modify their orientation by active locomotion, i.e. they had no or limited access
  to benthic prey at adulthood. Pathologies reported for heteromorphs were likely
  inflicted by crustaceans, fish, marine reptiles, and other cephalopods. Pathologies
  on Ptychoceras corroborates an external shell and rejects the endocochleate hypothesis.
  Devonian, Triassic, and Jurassic heteromorphs had a preference for deep-subtidal
  to offshore facies but are rare in shallow-subtidal, slope, and bathyal facies.
  Early Cretaceous heteromorphs preferred deep-subtidal to bathyal facies. Late Cretaceous
  heteromorphs are common in shallow-subtidal to offshore facies. Oxygen isotope data
  suggest rapid growth and a demersal habitat for adult Discoscaphites and Baculites.
  A benthic embryonic stage, planktic hatchlings, and a habitat change after one whorl
  is proposed for Hoploscaphites. Carbon isotope data indicate that some Baculites
  lived throughout their lives at cold seeps. Adaptation to a planktic life habit
  potentially drove selection towards smaller hatchlings, implying high fecundity
  and an ecological role of the hatchlings as micro- and mesoplankton. The Chicxulub
  impact at the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary 66 million years ago is the likely
  trigger for the extinction of ammonoids. Ammonoids likely persisted after this event
  for 40–500 thousand years and are exclusively represented by heteromorphs. The ammonoid
  extinction is linked to their small hatchling sizes, planktotrophic diets, and higher
  metabolic rates than in nautilids, which survived the K/Pg mass extinction event.
