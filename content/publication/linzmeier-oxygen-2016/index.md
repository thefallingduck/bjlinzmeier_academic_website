abstract: Nautilus  is often used as an analogue for the ecology and behavior of extinct
  externally shelled cephalopods.  Nautilus  shell grows quickly, has internal growth
  banding, and is widely believed to precipitate aragonite in oxygen isotope equilibrium
  with seawater. Pieces of shell from a wild-caught  Nautilus macromphalus  from New
  Caledonia and from a  Nautilus belauensis  reared in an aquarium were cast in epoxy,
  polished, and then imaged. Growth bands were visible in the outer prismatic layer
  of both shells. The thicknesses of the bands are consistent with previously reported
  daily growth rates measured in aquarium reared individuals.  In situ  analysis of
  oxygen isotope ratios using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) with 10 μm beam-spot
  size reveals inter- and intra-band δ 18 O variation. In the wild-caught sample,
  a traverse crosscutting 45 growth bands yielded δ 18 O values ranging 2.5‰, from
  +0.9 to -1.6 ‰ (VPDB), a range that is larger than that observed in many serial
  sampling of entire shells by conventional methods. The maximum range within a single
  band (~32 μm) was 1.5‰, and 27 out of 41 bands had a range larger than instrumental
  precision (±2 SD = 0.6‰). The results from the wild individual suggest depth migration
  is recorded by the shell, but are not consistent with a simple sinusoidal, diurnal
  depth change pattern. To create the observed range of δ 18 O, however, this  Nautilus  must
  have traversed a temperature gradient of at least ~12°C, corresponding to approximately
  400 m depth change. Isotopic variation was also measured in the aquarium-reared
  sample, but the pattern within and between bands likely reflects evaporative enrichment
  arising from a weekly cycle of refill and replacement of the aquarium water. Overall,
  this work suggests that depth migration behavior in ancient nektonic mollusks could
  be elucidated by SIMS analysis across individual growth bands.
