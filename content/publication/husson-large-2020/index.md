abstract: Ediacaran-aged (635–541 million years ago) marine sediments contain a large
  negative carbon isotope (δ13C) excursion, in which carbonate δ13C values reach −12‰
  (VPDB). Known as the ‘Shuram’ excursion, many workers have interpreted this δ13C
  record as an unprecedented perturbation to the global carbon cycle, leading to speculation
  about a causal connection to the broadly contemporaneous rise of animal life. Others
  have interpreted the δ13C signal as a product of diagenesis, thereby minimizing
  its relevance for understanding the evolution of metazoans. Here, we present SEM
  imaging and in-situ δ13C and δ18O values measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry
  (SIMS) to assess these competing hypotheses in the Wonoka Formation of South Australia.
  Our results from the minimum of the excursion show that rounded sedimentary grains
  of calcite have δ13C values between −12.8 to −10.6‰ and δ18O values between −17.8
  to −15.5‰ (VPDB). Euhedral dolomite that appears to have grown unimpeded in open
  sedimentary pore spaces also is present. These early-stage dolomites are interpreted
  as early authigenic in origin and have δ13C values that reach +5‰, requiring a formation
  fluid with a substantially different δ13C composition from basin waters or bulk
  sediment. Together, these results provide little evidence for the hypothesis that
  a late diagenetic overprint has generated the ‘Shuram’ excursion in the Wonoka.
  Instead, they suggest the presence of a large carbon isotopic gradient in the surface
  environment, with shallow waters capable of precipitating carbonates with very low
  δ13C (down to −12‰) and deeper shelf and/or marine pore waters generating carbonates
  with positive carbon isotope values (up to +5‰). Because negative isotope excursions
  of similar magnitude are found in widely dispersed Ediacaran basins, it is likely
  that this gradient was characteristic of shelf environments of this period and that
  a still-unknown global process led to the ‘Shuram’ excursion in shallow water carbonates.
