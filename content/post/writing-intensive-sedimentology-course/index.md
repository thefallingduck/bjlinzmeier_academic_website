I mentioned teaching this course on Twitter a few weeks ago and there was some interest in seeing my materials. This post shares a few things that I have prepared so far for the course. The most important pieces are the scaffolding (small writing projects to build skills) and the semester project overview. All of these have been made using R markdown and compiled as LaTeX documents with Knitr. I will share more about this process in a blog post in the future.
