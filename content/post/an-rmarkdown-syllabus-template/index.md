This is a work in progress, but I thought it would be useful to share. I am making three course syllabuses for spring semester and have put together an R markdown template to help speed up the process. There are several features that work for my new workflow and may be useful to the broader community of instructors.

1. Automatically populate class meeting dates based on semester schedule.
2. Recycle portions of text across multiple syllabuses.
3. Create well-formatted contact information for all instructors and TAs in a course.

The code is at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/thefallingduck/RmdSyllabus). In it you will find instructions for what can be replaced within the document for customizing it to your own school's schedule.
